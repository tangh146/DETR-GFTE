# DETR-GFTE Graph-based Table Recognition

Experimental graph-based table recognition models based on [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) and [GFTE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07560).

## Usage

STEP 1: Download and install `requirements.txt`.

STEP 2: [Download the checkpoints folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1luUrVkRi4txh5Pt_TSnyh3Jg3x26oAXh?usp=sharing) and place it in this directory.

STEP 3: You may now run the `inference.ipynb` notebooks.

STEP 4: To run the `evaluation.ipynb` and `training.ipynb` notebooks, [download the PubTabNet dataset](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/pubtabnet/) and follow the instructions in the notebooks to prepare the `.jsonl` annotation files.
